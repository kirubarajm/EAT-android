    <string name="terms_and_conditions"><![CDATA[TERMS AND CONDITIONS  This document is an electronic record in terms of Information Technology Act, 2000 and rules there under as applicable and the amended provisions pertaining to electronic records in various statutes as amended by the Information Technology Act, 2000. This document is published in accordance with the provisions of Rule 3 (1) of the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 that require publishing the rules and regulations, privacy policy and Terms of Use for access or usage of EAT application for mobile and handheld devices. Terms Of Use These terms of use (the “ Terms of Use”) govern your use of our “EAT” application for mobile and handheld devices (the “ App”). Please read these Terms of Use carefully before you use the services. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use the services on the App, and we request you to uninstall the App. By installing, downloading or even merely using the Platform, you shall be contracting with EAT and you signify your acceptance of the Terms of Use and other EAT policies (including but not limited to the Cancellation & Refund Policy, Privacy Policy and Take Down Policy) as posted on the App from time to time, which takes effect on the date on which you download, install or use the Services, and create a legally binding arrangement to abide by the same. The Platform is operated and owned by Tovologies Private Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and having its registered office at AGM Towers, Guindy, Chennai - 600038. For the purpose of these Terms of Use, wherever the context so requires, ”you” shall mean any natural or legal person who has agreed to become a buyer or customer on the App by providing Registration Data while registering on the Platform as a registered user using any computer systems. The terms “EAT”, “we”, “us” or “our” shall mean Tovologies Private Limited. EAT enables transactions between participant merchants and buyers, dealing in prepared food and beverages (“Platform Services”). The buyers (“Buyer/s”) can choose and place orders (“Orders”) from a variety of products listed and offered for sale by various neighbourhood merchants on the Platform and EAT enables delivery of such orders at select localities across Chennai (“Delivery Services”). The Platform Services and Delivery Services are collectively referred to as “Services”. AMENDMENTS These Terms of Use are subject to modifications at any time. We reserve the right to modify or change these Terms of Use and other EAT policies at any time by posting changes on the Platform, and you shall be liable to update yourself of such changes, if any, by accessing the changes on the Platform. You shall, at all times, be responsible for regularly reviewing the Terms of Use and the other EAT policies and note the changes made on the Platform. Your continued usage of the services after any change is posted constitutes your acceptance of the amended Terms of Use and other EAT policies. As long as you comply with these Terms of Use, EAT grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited privilege to access, enter, and use the Platform. By accepting these Terms of Use, you also accept and agree to be bound by the other terms and conditions and EAT policies (including but not limited to Cancellation & Refund Policy, Privacy Policy and Notice and Take Down Policy) as may be posted on the Platform from time to time. Use of Platform and Services All commercial/contractual terms are offered by and agreed to between Buyers and Merchants alone. The commercial/contractual terms include without limitation price, taxes, shipping costs, payment methods, payment terms, date, period and mode of delivery, warranties related to products and services and after sales services related to products and services. EAT does not have any control or does not determine or advise or in any way involve itself in the offering or acceptance of such commercial/contractual terms between the Buyers and Merchants. EAT may, however, offer support services to Merchants in respect to order fulfilment, payment collection, call centre, and other services, pursuant to independent contracts executed by it with the Merchants. EAT does not make any representation or warranty as to the item-specifics (such as legal title, creditworthiness, identity, etc.) of any of the Merchants. You are advised to independently verify the bona fides of any particular Merchant that you choose to deal with on the Platform and use your best judgment in that behalf. All Merchant offers are subject to the respective party terms and conditions. EAT takes no responsibility for such offers. EAT neither make any representation or warranty as to specifics (such as quality, value, salability, etc.) of the products or services proposed to be sold or offered to be sold or purchased on the Platform nor does implicitly or explicitly support or endorse the sale or purchase of any products or services on the Platform. EAT accepts no liability for any errors or omissions, whether on behalf of itself or third parties. EAT is not responsible for any non-performance or breach of any contract entered into between Buyers and Merchants on the Platform. EAT cannot and does not guarantee that the concerned Buyers and/or Merchants will perform any transaction concluded on the Platform. EAT is not responsible for unsatisfactory or non-performance of services or damages or delays as a result of products which are out of stock, unavailable or back ordered. EAT is operating as an online marketplace and assumes the role of facilitator, and does not at any point of time during any transaction between Buyer and Merchant on the Platform come into or take possession of any of the products or services offered by Merchant. At no time shall EAT hold any right, title or interest over the products nor shall EAT have any obligations or liabilities in respect of such contract entered into between Buyer and Merchant. EAT is only providing a platform for communication and it is agreed that the contract for sale of any of the products or services shall be a strictly bipartite contract between the Merchant and the Buyer. In case of complaints from the Buyer pertaining to food efficacy, quality, or any other such issues, EAT shall notify the same to Merchant and shall also redirect the Buyer to the consumer call center of the Merchant. The Merchant shall be liable for redressing Buyer complaints.
